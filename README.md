## Responsive Navigation Menu for FitnessPro

### Overview
This project implements a responsive navigation menu for the FitnessPro website, designed to provide an intuitive as well as  seamless user experience across various devices. Also, the navigation menu includes a hamburger menu that dynamically toggles the visibility of the navigation links on the smaller screens, which is ensuring ease of use and accessibility.

### Design Choices

#### 1. **Responsive Layout**
- The navigation menu is designed to adapt to different screen sizes using CSS media queries.
- On devices with a width greater than 768px, the navigation links are displayed inline.
- On smaller devices, a hamburger menu appears, which is allowing users to toggle the visibility of the navigation links.

#### 2. **Hamburger Menu Animation**
- The hamburger menu features a clean animation where the bars transform into a cross (X) shape when toggled.
- This animation provides clear visual feedback to the user, indicating the menu’s open or closed state.

#### 3. **User Experience**
- Clicking on any navigation link automatically closes the menu, ensuring that users have an unobstructed view of the selected page.
- A focus on simplicity and clarity in the design ensures users can navigate the site effortlessly.

### Implementation Approach

#### 1. **Component Structure**
- **Navbar Component**: Handles the main navigation logic, including toggling and closing the menu.
- **HamburgerMenu Component**: A reusable component for rendering the animated hamburger icon.
- **React Router**: Used to handle navigation between different pages of the application.

#### 2. **State Management**
- The `useState` hook is used to manage the `isMenuOpen` state, which determines whether the menu is open or closed.

#### 3. **Event Handling**
- The `toggleMenu` function toggles the menu’s open/close state when the hamburger icon is clicked.
- The `closeMenu` function is triggered when any navigation link is clicked, ensuring the menu closes after navigation.

#### 4. **CSS Styling**
- CSS classes (`.nav-links`, `.hamburger-menu`, `.bar`) are dynamically updated based on the `isMenuOpen` state to control visibility and animations.
- Media queries ensure the navigation adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes.

### Functionality

#### **Navigation Links**
- The navigation menu includes links to the following pages:
  - Home
  - Workouts
  - Nutrition
  - Plans
  - Progress Tracker
  - Community
- Clicking a link navigates to the corresponding page and closes the menu.

#### **Responsive Hamburger Menu**
- On small screens, a hamburger menu appears. Clicking it toggles the visibility of the navigation links.
- The animation of the menu icon provides visual feedback, improving usability.

#### **Dynamic Link Behavior**
- Each navigation link uses the `onClick` event to close the menu upon selection, ensuring an uncluttered interface.

#### **React Router Integration**
- The navigation seamlessly integrates with React Router to allow smooth transitions between pages without reloading.
